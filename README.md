This is your Second Brain.

Notes in text form only! No "large files" (aka pdf, high resolution pictures, ...)

> [!info] Functionality

It's supposed to take away admin stress of every day life without adding effort to maintain it.
It acts as a external long term memory, so that your brain can do what it can do best: Be creative, build new connections - instead of having to do what a brain can't do: Keep sth in mind / remember a lot of "data".


> [!warning] Goal
> Free up time so you can enjoy the present moments with your loved ones

> [!Note]
To achieve that, it follows some simple principles.
>
Here's my quick approach of summarizing them:

> [!example] Principles
> 1. Note down what you appears important to you
> 2. Don't be sad when you did not note sth down - if you forgot, it wasn't important, or it comes back to you
> 3. One's you put sth in here, forget about it - it's stored and won't get forgotten ;)


> [!tip] Folder types 
> They follow the PARA principle ([Youtube video on that](https://youtu.be/T6Mfl1OywM8?si=F-clJwbCpgovFH-1))
Have a look into the readme files of the individual subfolders, they contain suggestions

> [!Note] On typesetting
It uses Markdown format
That's designed to be simple and easy to use and still make boring text appear colourful and beautiful

> To understand better in which ways you might make us of this to improve your life, read or listen to the book of Tiago Forte (... second brain ... is in the title). 


# Daily notes

Your obsidian is set up to create a daily note based on a preconfigured template.
You can find it [[YYYY-MM-DD|here]]
Edit it to your liking (it will apply to all newly created files, not old ones!)

They will be stored in the top level folder and clutter it up after a while.
Throw old ones into the Archive folder when that happens.
Talk to your friends about possibilities how to do that in a smart way.
